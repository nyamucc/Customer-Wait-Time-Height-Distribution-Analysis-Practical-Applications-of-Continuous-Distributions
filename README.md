# Customer-Wait-Time-Height-Distribution-Analysis-Practical-Applications-of-Continuous-Distributions
### Exploring Continuous Distributions (Exponential & Normal) in Data Science

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore the practical applications of continuous probability distributions by using synthetic datasets. 
We focus on Exponential Distribution for modeling customer wait times and Normal Distribution for heights. Through statistical 
distribution fitting, hypothesis testing, and visualization, this project demonstrates how continuous distributions are applied 
to model real-world phenomena.

## Key Areas of Application
📌 **Exponential Distribution (Customer Wait Times)**

- Real-World Use: The Exponential Distribution is commonly used in queuing theory and operations research to model the waiting times in systems like call centers, hospitals, and customer service lines. By analyzing customer wait times, businesses can improve service efficiency and optimize resources.

- Project Use: We generate synthetic wait times based on the Exponential Distribution to simulate customer waiting times, with a mean of 5 minutes.

📌 **Normal Distribution (Heights of People)**

- Real-World Use: The Normal Distribution is one of the most commonly encountered distributions in natural and social sciences, often used to model traits like height, weight, test scores, and many other variables in a population.

- Project Use: We generate synthetic customer heights based on the Normal Distribution with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
2. Install Dependencies
3. Run the Script
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nyamucc/Customer-Wait-Time-Height-Distribution-Analysis-Practical-Applications-of-Continuous-Distributions.git
   cd Customer-Wait-Time-Height-Distribution-Analysis-Practical-Applications-of-Continuous-Distributions

📌 Results & Insights

Wait times follow an Exponential Distribution (confirmed via KS test).
Heights follow a Normal Distribution (confirmed via Shapiro-Wilk test).
Exponential distributions are right-skewed, while normal distributions are symmetric.
