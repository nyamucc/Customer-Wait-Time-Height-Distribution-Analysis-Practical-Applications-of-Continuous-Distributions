# Customer-Wait-Time-Height-Distribution-Analysis-Practical-Applications-of-Continuous-Distributions

## Project Overview
n this project, we explore the practical applications of continuous probability distributions by using synthetic datasets. 
We focus on Exponential Distribution for modeling customer wait times and Normal Distribution for heights. Through statistical 
distribution fitting, hypothesis testing, and visualization, this project demonstrates how continuous distributions are applied 
to model real-world phenomena.
